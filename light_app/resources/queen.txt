Love of my life, You hurt me.
You've broken my heart,
And now you leave me.

Love of my life, can't you see ...
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me.

Because you don't know
What it means to me.

Love of my life, You leave me.
You've stolen my love,
You now desert me.

Love of my life, can't you see ...
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me.

Because you don't know
What it means to me.

Don't you remember
How this is blown over
And everythings all by the way.
When I'll get older
I will be there, At your side
To remind you
How I still love you.
    I still love you ...

Back, hurry back,
Don't take it away from me.
'Cause you don't know
What it means to me.

Love of my life ...
Love of my life ...
Oh Oh Yeh ...
